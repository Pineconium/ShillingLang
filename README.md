# What is _Shilling_?
Shilling is a little programming language designed to, well to put it simpily, stand out from the crowd regarding syntax and function names. This repo contains the documentation (shown in `START.MD`) as well as some example projects.

**Note that this repo doesn't contain any compilers or interputers, you'll need to either make one yourself or find one somewhere else.**
